## Research Overview

This project investigates Paleoproterozoic glacial diamictites from South Africa (âˆ¼2.4 Ga) through detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology. The study focuses on three key objectives:

1. **Age Determination**  
   Constraining depositional timing of Neoproterozoic glacial events using zircon age spectra.

2. **Provenance Analysis**  
   Tracing sediment sources through U-Pb isotopic signatures and cathodoluminescence textures.

3. **Paleoenvironmental Context**  
   Correlating detrital zircon records with atmospheric oxygen fluctuations during the Great Oxidation Event.

The analyzed samples (EBA1, DP22, DUIT3) represent distinct stratigraphic units from the Transvaal Supergroup, selected for their preservation of glacial signatures and zircon abundance.
