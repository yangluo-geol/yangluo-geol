  {% if course.skills %}
  <span class="course-skills">Skills emphasized: {{ course.skills | join: ", " }}</span>
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

### Key Responsibilities
- Designed and led weekly laboratory sessions for 20-30 undergraduate students
- Developed instructional materials including:
  - Mineral identification flow charts
  - Structural geology problem sets
  - Resource evaluation case studies
- Conducted office hours and provided individualized academic support
- Evaluated and provided feedback on:
  - Laboratory reports (15-20 pages each)
  - Field mapping exercises
  - Final research projects
- Assisted faculty with course development and curriculum improvements

### Teaching Philosophy
My approach emphasizes:
- Hands-on, experiential learning in laboratory and field settings
- Integrating current research into undergraduate curriculum
- Developing quantitative and analytical skills through geoscience applications
- Fostering inclusive learning environments
