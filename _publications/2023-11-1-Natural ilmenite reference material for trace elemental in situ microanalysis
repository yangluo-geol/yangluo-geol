Ilmenite is a common mineral in igneous and metamorphic rocks used as a geothermometer, oxygen barometer, and geochemical tracer. This study developed a 500 g ilmenite megacryst (sample LY) as a reference material for in situ elemental microanalysis. Twenty-two ilmenite fragments (1–8 mm grain size) were analyzed using EMPA and LA-ICP-MS across four laboratories.

The sample shows homogeneity for TiO₂, FeO, Mg, Sc, V, Cr, and Mn, with minor inhomogeneity observed in Co and Nb. These results indicate the sample’s suitability as a reliable reference material for major and trace element in situ microanalysis.
