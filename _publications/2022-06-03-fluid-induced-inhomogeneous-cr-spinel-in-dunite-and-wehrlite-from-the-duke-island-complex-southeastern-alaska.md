Cr-spinel [(Mg, Fe²⁺)(Cr, Al, Fe³⁺)₂O₄] is a common mineral in the ultramafic core of the Duke Island Complex in southeastern Alaska. This study identifies inhomogeneous Cr-spinel grains[...]

Three subtypes of inhomogeneous Cr-spinel are recognized: 
- Type B1: complete separation 
- Type B2: crystallographically oriented 
- Type B3: irregular Al-rich rims around type B3 Cr-spinel.

The unmixing process occurred near 600 °C due to a miscibility gap in spinel between Al-rich and Fe³⁺-rich phases. The pattern of unmixing is influenced by initial spinel composition, grain size[...]

This work highlights the potential of Cr-spinel unmixing textures as proxies for high-temperature fluid activity in mantle-derived ultramafic complexes.
