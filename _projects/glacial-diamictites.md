summary: "Detrital zircon dating of South African glacial diamictites linked to early atmospheric oxygen oscillations."
layout: project
---

These **glacial diamictites** from South Africa, around 2.4 billion years old, are crucial to understanding the oscillating rise of atmospheric oxygen during the **Paleoproterozoic Great Oxidation Event**.

Key components:
- Field sampling in South Africa  
- Uâ€“Pb zircon dating  
- Sediment geochemistry  

The results provide new constraints on Paleoproterozoic glaciations and oxygenation cycles.
