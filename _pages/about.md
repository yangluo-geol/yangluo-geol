I am Yang Luo, a Ph.D. student specializing in Geochemistry at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research focuses on petrology, isotope geochemistry, crustal evolution, and processes that shaped the early Earth.

This website showcases my academic work including publications, talks, teaching materials, and ongoing projects. It is built with the Academic Pages template and hosted on GitHub Pages.

GitHub Pages is a free service that automatically builds and publishes websites directly from code repositories on GitHub, making it easy to maintain an up-to-date professional academic website.

You can explore my research interests and contributions in geochemistry, learn about my latest work, and find resources related to petrology and isotope geochemistry.

### About this Site

This site is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) which is designed for academic personal websites. It supports structured content like publications, talks, teaching, portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically generated CV.

The site uses Markdown and YAML files to separate content from design, making it easy to update and maintain. Each time I push changes to my GitHub repository, GitHub Pages automatically rebuilds and publishes the site.

For those interested in extending or customizing the site, the template supports tools such as:

- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for rendering mathematical equations  
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagrams  
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for interactive plots  

Feel free to browse around and contact me via email at yangluo@ucsb.edu for any questions or collaborations.
